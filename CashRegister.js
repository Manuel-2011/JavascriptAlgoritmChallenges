/*
Design a cash register drawer function checkCashRegister() that accepts purchase price as the first argument (price), payment as the second argument (cash), and cash-in-drawer (cid) as the third argument.

cid is a 2D array listing available currency.

The checkCashRegister() function should always return an object with a status key and a change key.

Return {status: "INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS", change: []} if cash-in-drawer is less than the change due, or if you cannot return the exact change.

Return {status: "CLOSED", change: [...]} with cash-in-drawer as the value for the key change if it is equal to the change due.

Otherwise, return {status: "OPEN", change: [...]}, with the change due in coins and bills, sorted in highest to lowest order, as the value of the change key.

Currency Unit	Amount
Penny	$0.01 (PENNY)
Nickel	$0.05 (NICKEL)
Dime	$0.1 (DIME)
Quarter	$0.25 (QUARTER)
Dollar	$1 (ONE)
Five Dollars	$5 (FIVE)
Ten Dollars	$10 (TEN)
Twenty Dollars	$20 (TWENTY)
One-hundred Dollars	$100 (ONE HUNDRED)
